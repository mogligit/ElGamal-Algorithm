# ElGamal Algorithm

This is an implementation of the ElGamal encryption algorithm I did on my second year of college, as part of my Computer Science A-Level.

It's in Visual Basic .NET

Please see the [original branch](https://github.com/mogligit/ElGamal-Algorithm/tree/original "original branch") for the original implementation from years ago. I plan on upgrading this branch to be better and faster than the original one.
